Made to solve sudokus on https://sudoku.com/
On expert difficulty it typically reads the sudoku in 3 seconds and solves it in around 5 in my experience. Adjusting the constants in websiteinterface.py might be needed to get it to work on other setups. Different rendering of the numbers might ruin the number recognition. Works in python 3.7.9, had some bugs in the libraries used when in python 3.9
